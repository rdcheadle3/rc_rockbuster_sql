# Rockbuster Stealth Data Analysis Project

## Context

Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a FAKE movie rental company that used to have stores around the
world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime,
the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to
launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.

## Objective

To answer the questions posed by the different departments, you’ll query the data using SQL. The results of your analysis will be presented to Rockbuster management, so you’ll need to visualize the data in an easy-to-consume manner.
